### Hi there üëã,

I'm Ana Claudia, or just Ana :)

I have a degree in Electrical Engineering and in the end of 2021 I discovered a new passion, finding insights and solving problems through data. Since then, I have dedicated myself to learning Data Science. :woman_technologist:

### DATA SCIENCE PROJECTS

#### [SALES PREDICTIONS FOR A DRUGSTORE CHAIN](https://github.com/anaclaudialemos/drugstore_sales_prediction)   
**Business Problem:** Rossmann is a pharmacy chain that operates over 3,000 stores in 7 European countries. The stores are going to be renovated and the CFO needs to know how much can be invested in each one of them.   

**Solution:** Develop a prediction model for sales and a telegram bot (ongoing) that returns sales predictions given a store id number.

**Conclusion:** The model developed predicts a gross income of $285.71 MM in the next 6 weeks for the stores available, where the best and worst case scenarios results on $286.42 MM and $284.99 MM, respectively.

#### [E-COMMERCE CUSTOMER SATISFACTION PREDICITION](https://github.com/anaclaudialemos/predicting_customer_satisfaction)   
**Business Problem:** Olist is an e-commerce intermediary from Brazil that provides a platform to connect merchants and their products to the main marketplaces in Brazil. Providing better services to customers is one of the main keys to success as an e-commerce seller. For sellers, Knowing whether the review score is positive or negative, plays a crucial role in improving the business. But often, customers don't give ratings or comments.   

**Solution:** Predict the customer satisfaction (positive or negative) for the next purchases made from Brazilian e-commerce intermediated by Olist.   

**Conclusion:** The model has an accuracy of 72%. For the positive review scores, the model was able to correctly identify 56.60%. Most important for the business is the correct identification of negative scores, since misclassification of negative scores can result in loss of customers. For negative score identification the model was able to correctly identify 65%. The model still needs to be improved. Since the predictor variables have a weak relationship with the target variable, working more on feature engineering and using an algorithm for feature selection is something that might help.

#### [HOUSING MARKET INSIGHTS - DATA ANALISIS](https://github.com/anaclaudialemos/housing_market_analysis)

The data scientist is in charge to help find the best business opportunities by answering the questions. Which properties should the company buy Once the property is in the company's possession, how long wait before selling it, and what would ta the sale price be?   

**Solution:** Develop a online dashboard with selected properties, a map view with properties distribution, a table with attributes filters, and the expected profit for each property.

**Conclusion:** Based on commercial criteria, 8,130 properties are recommended to be purchased by House Rocket resulting in a profit of 702,080,905.28 USD, which represents 20.33% of the total investment. This result already considering repairs or renovations expenses.

#### [WEBSCRAPING AND ANALYSIS OF FASHION TRENDS AND PRICING](https://github.com/anaclaudialemos/housing_market_analysis)   

**Business Problem:** Mariana and Laura are planning to enter the US fashion market as an e-commerce business model. The initial idea is to enter the market with only one product and for a specific public, i,n this case the product would be jeans for the female public. However, even with the entrance product and the audience defined, the partners have no experience in this fashion market and therefore do not know how to define basic things like price, the type of jeans, and the main materials to manufacture each piece. So the partners hired a Data Science consultancy to answer the following questions: what would be the medium sales ticket of the products? what are the types of jeans and their colors for the initial products? what are the product's compositions?   

**Solution:** Follow the steps: ETL architecture design, web scraping, data cleansing, saving data to database, data analysis, delivery of answers and insights via report.

**Conclusion:** The medium price of the competitor's products is 29.99 USD. 75% of the products in the dataset are between 17.99 USD and 34.99 USD. Of the 24 styles present in the dataset, 8 represent 80% of the products in the dataset: straightleg, tapered mom, straightleg widecut, skinny, slim, jeggings, mom straightleg, and widecut. In terms of length and waist, the ankle and long lengths represent practically 100% of the products, and 82.37% have either a high or ultra high waist. About the fit, 80% of the products have fit loose, regular, or slim. Of the 46 colors available 7 represent 80% of the products in the dataset: light denim blue, denim blue, black, dark denim blue, white, and pale denim blue. Jeans that are not 100% cotton are most often also made of spandex and polyester. Almost 80% of products have some percentage of material that is considered environmentally responsible.
